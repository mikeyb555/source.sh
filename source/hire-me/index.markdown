I'm an Australian Software Engineer currently exploring the US and looking for new opportunities.

For the past few years I have been working in the electricity retailing industry, developing software for reporting and workflows. I also hold  degrees in Engineering and Commerce, majoring in Software and Finance. For my Engineering degree I completed a thesis focused on machine learning, specifically clustering algorithms.

Email me at michael @ thisdomain for my resume.
