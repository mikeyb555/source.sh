The Guardian and WSJ have been running stories on the imminent launch of Facebook at Work (F@W). I'm really excited about this and I think its going to wipe the floor with the alternatives.

##The best Messaging platform

Facebook has the best messaging platform hands down. Facebook Messenger is the fastest sending messaging on app on iOS. Alternatives like Hangouts and Slack have average apps that send messages really slowly and often fail to send messages. I'm not sure why this is (it seems to be unique to iOS) but its a dealbreaker. Additionally Messenger is the only app where a decent number of your contacts are likely to be on. It also has decently useful features such as picture annotation and read receipts.

The weakness at the moment is you have to actually be on facebook to use messenger, and a torrent of buzzfeed articles is not conducive to productive discussions. This platform in a distraction free web environment would be a Slack/Hipchat killer (in fact there is already a chrome extension to do just that https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/distraction-free-facebook/ipkbhlfkopeokhpbhgmlonagpppedfej?hl=en).

The only other weakness of Messenger at the moment is average search functionality, something Slack is excellent at. I suspect this is more a matter of allocated resources though, there is no need for powerful search on inane conversations with your friends. Facebook have been doing a lot of work in general with search and I suspect better search across the board including Messenger will be part of F@W.

##The best (really) team management platform

Ok, so thats a big call. Yes there are many alternatives with better functionality (Atlassian products, Basecamp etc.). Sure these products have been deployed successfully at large enterprises. However these projects are a walk in the park compared to the highest stakes, highest stress and most confrontational form of team management - university group projects. Anyone who has been through an undergraduate degree knows the deal, the mysterious team members who only materialize to collect their mark, the lack of updates as deadlines inch closer, the too-common situation of one team member doing all the work and the histrionics that follow.
